# Elizabeth_Chiduku_Simply_Responsive
I created the website using media queries without changing the title tag as the screen resizes.
This Responsive Web was all about making a website fluid and proportional
Elements used to make this website fluid and proportional; Phone	Width less than or equal to 480px, Tablet	Width between 481px and 1023px, Desktop	Width greater than or equal to 1024px
